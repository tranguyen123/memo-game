  "description": "this game was designed to test the user memory, and I used very funny pictures of rare creatures to make the game more interesting. And here is how the game should function: -The application renders different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events. -The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. -Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. -Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart. Enjoy the game.",
