# animal-clicky-game
this game was designed to test the user memory, and I used very funny pictures of rare creatures to make the game more interesting. And here is how the game should function:
-The application renders different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
-The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
-Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
-Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
Enjoy the game.
